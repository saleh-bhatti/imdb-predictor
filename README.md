With its enormous collection of movie information as well as millions of user contributors, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) website is the 3rd most visited movie-related site worldwide, behind only Youtube and Netflix according to similarweb.com. Given its popularity, The IMDb rating system has become a widely accepted and trusted indicator of a film’s critical reception among consumers. A strong IMDb rating can generate positive word of mouth, drive ticket sales, and ultimately help the film achieve long-term success while a low IMDb rating can have the opposite effect, tanking the film’s reputation. 

Given its widespread use and influence on consumer behaviour, IMDb ratings are an important metric for movie studios and distributors to consider. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict a film’s IMDb rating, solely using data available pre-release of the film. This will help movie studios make informed decisions when planning and executing projects as well as provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to a strong rating.
